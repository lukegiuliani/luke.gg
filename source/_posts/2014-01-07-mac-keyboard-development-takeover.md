If you're a Mac developer and you spend most of your working time in the cosy set up that is the desk-computer-mouse-keyboard-headphones, you've probably heard of someone who has sat through some hard lessons on RSI (Repetitive Strain Injury). If you haven't, you're about to!

My physio gave me exercises, told me to change my habits on the computer and practice more ergonomic positioning of my wrists and arms. They said that if I wanted to continue to use a mouse in the same professional capacity, I would need to change. My problem came about from moving my hand from mouse to keyboard and back again, hundreds of times a day.

Luckily, it's definitely possible to get rid of most mouse use through accessibility changes and shortcuts.

Here are the tools and tips I've found invaluable for helping me reduce my time with ol' Apple swipey mouse.

## Shortcat

This is a lovely little application that can add keyboard accessibility to most apps and tools you use. By hitting a defined universal 
shortcut, you bring up a little search window, similar to **[Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/)** or the native Mac launcher. You then begin to type what you want to click on or 
interact with. As you type, the element that relates to your query will become highlighted with a letter. Hit `Ctrl+LETTER` and you will enact the 
action a mouse would have.

In my experience, it bugs out a bit in chrome but going to [chrome://accessibility/](chrome://accessibility/) and setting the global accessibility flag to 'on' helps with this a lot.

## Shortcutfoo
 
One of the hardest parts of getting to keyboard-only is using the right shortcuts. Luckily, most decent programs created for Mac have very decent levels of accessibility. The fact of their existence is inadequate however, as learning 300+ shortcuts quickly is problematic. Shortcutfoo is a site that houses most of the commonly used Mac tools and gives you a playground where you can learn and test your knowledge of shortcuts for a given app.
