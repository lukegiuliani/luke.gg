Are you fatigued from reading long requirements specifications, guarding project scope with your life, waiting 6+ months for delivery, and producing finished products that don't meet the current business need? If so, then Agile could be for you.

At Squareweave we specialise in Agile project delivery and here's why we love it.

###1. Speed to market

Agile focusses on building the most important high value features first, quickly creating a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Research suggests that 80% of all market leaders were first to market.

###2. Make money faster

The iterative nature of Agile allows for release of the MVP while other features are still in development, enabling early revenue generation and real time feedback before the product is complete.

###9. Reducing the risk 

Regular incremental showcases give the product owner opportunities to review project development and make it easier to respond to change. This clear visibility that Agile provides helps to address issues as early as possible in the project and while there is still enough time and resources available to make changes.


###3. Change is easy

In Agile development change is expected and the process allows for that. Time and cost are fixed while requirements evolve and emerge as the product is developed. During planning, product owners prioritise features for the up-coming iterations (we call these sprints) and are encouraged to introduce newly realised features that come as a result of a previous showcase.

###4. High visibility

Users and product owners are actively involved in a collaborative way during the lifecycle of the project, thus providing a high level of stakeholder involvement. Stakeholders are kept informed of both product and project progress which helps to ensure their expectations are effectively managed.

###5. It's fun and exciting

Agile can deliver an MVP to market extremely quickly and new features are continuously added. This speed generates excitement and a real buzz for product owners, stakeholders, and the development team early in the project lifecycle, compared to a more traditional approach where delivery can often take place 6+ months from project kick-off. The active involvement along with the collaborative and cooperative nature of Agile project teams make them an enjoyable experience for most people.

###6. It's lean

Agile is an implementation of Lean which means anything that isn't adding value to the product is regarded as waste, and not included in the process. Lengthy requirements specifications and status reports are replaced with fun, engaging workshops, daily stand-up meetings, and task boards (we use Atlasssian Jira). Instead of project plans and change control meetings we discuss what's right for the project and product, and the team is empowered to make decisions.

###7. Quality 

A key principle of Agile development is that testing is integrated into the project, enabling regular inspection of the product during development. This gives the product owner early visibility of any potential issues or problems and ample time to resolve not only bugs but issues with user experience or feature sets.

###8. Customer satisfaction

The active involvement of the product owner in Agile projects, the high visibility within stakeholder groups, and the flexibility to change when needed create a greater level of business engagement and customer satisfaction. 


###10. Costs are fixed

In Agile projects cost and time scales are fixed and requirements evolve as the product is developed. In the kick-off workshop we use a simple technique to estimate the time and cost of your project.
