		<p>Something changed when we reached a dozen employees.</p>
		<p>The heroic acts of our talented designers and hackers - whilst impressive - became an untenable pattern. We looked at what we&rsquo;d achieved and who we were, and we felt lost.</p>
		<p>I took my Grandparents for a trip to Mona down in Hobart. We went to the theatre together and I thought about family and lineage and death. About what lingers. </p>
		<p>I thought on work and life and the family I spend 40 hours of every week making money with. A truth surfaced:</p>
		<q>There is no upper limit for family size</q>
		<p>What&rsquo;s important is the knowledge and evidence that each day spent together matters. But how can you know?</p>

		<h2>Balance</h2>
		<p>When we started the company 5 years ago it lived in a trembling point of tension. Between art and code, between business and pleasure. Between social impact and making cash. It was instinct, not strategy. It worked.</p>
		<p>At points we paused and wondered why. Should we sell the company, move to Africa and build wells? Aim for the cash and do a Bill Gates?</p>
		<p>With that question in mind, we started to attract change-makers as clients. The gravity drew us inexorably towards education and social impact. Youth, mental health, climate change. Not-for-profits. For profits. For purpose.</p>
		<p>At times we put aspirational lines in the sand about what &lsquo;impact&rsquo; meant. Percentage of revenue from not for profits? Not good enough. B-Corp status? Maybe. Pro bono work? No. Another truth bubbled up.</p>

		<q>Hold your breath and you lose it</q>
		<p>Our best work is found in creative tension. Not the &lsquo;right&rsquo; answer. The best lever, pulled at the right time.</p>
		<p>It morphs because our weapon of choice - the internet - is a powerful and changing beast. It&rsquo;s huge. It hasn&rsquo;t stopped. It probably won&rsquo;t. It demolishes entire industries and rebuilds them again as thundering digital phoenixes.</p>
		<p>The dudes in suits label this &lsquo;disruption&rsquo;.</p>
		<p>It shines a harsh light on the big movers. Education, finance, government. What it means to be employed.</p>
		<p>Thrown into a sudden and stark relief, a desperate need for radical shifts in thinking and action appears. The best levers seem to be digital, education and culture change.</p>

		<p>From the relative safety of our studio, we can't be 100% certain what work we&rsquo;ll be doing a year from now. We can however, boil down these feelings into practical principles from which all else flows.</p>

		<h2>First Principles</h2>

		<h3>We support changer-makers with ambitious missions, who need the partnership that will get things done.</h3>
		<dl>
			<dt>1</dt><dd>We pull the best levers, at the right time, for the most impact. We believe in education and technology as tools for positive change.</dd>
			<dt>2</dt><dd>Our best work is done in creative tension between business and social good, where there&rsquo;s space for growth and innovation.</dd>
			<dt>3</dt><dd>Tomorrow we will solve problems that didn&rsquo;t exist today, using tools that havenâ€™t been invented yet.</dd>
			<dt>4</dt><dd>We are authentic, open and a little bit strange. It starts in the heart and the head guides. It extends from our team, through to our families, children, friends and networks.</dd>
			<dt>5</dt><dd>We are bold and truthful, for truth is scaleable.</dd>
		</dl>

		<p>We&rsquo;ll continue to question these ideas as we grow, both outwards and inwards.</p>
