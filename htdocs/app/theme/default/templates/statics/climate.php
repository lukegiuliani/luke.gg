			<p class="standfirst">The Climate Council is living proof that a small, committed group can create a measurable impact on a large scale.</p>
			<p>Squareweave has learnt how to be a truly supportive digital partner. Together, we&rsquo;re kicking goals that organisations ten times our combined size struggle to get near.</p>		
			<p>This is a story about the impact that good digital enables.</p>
			<p>The journey starts with a record-breaking crowd funding outcome, under the combined weight of over 20,000 individual Australia voices rising in unison:</p>
		

<!--
			<p>The Climate Council is a story about true digital impact and supporter engagement.</p>
			<p>When Tony Abbot sacked the Climate Coalition, Australians came out in support for a common sense, scientific discussion around climate change.</p>
			<p>Over 20,000 Australians donated to The Climate Council so they could continue the debate online and offline.</p>
			<p>Whilst the end results speak for themselves, the path of learning wasn&rsquo;t always so clear cut.</p>


		  <p class="standfirst">Tony Abbott&rsquo;s first act of government was to sack the Climate Coalition.</p>
		  <p>This was widely regarded by scientists, science communicators and average Australians as a bad move.</p>
			<p>The team that leapt sideways formed <a href="http://climatecouncil.org.au" target="_blank">The Climate Council</a>, an independent, not for profit with the mandate to change the public discourse around climate change.</p>

		<h3>The really exciting thing was the proof that loose-link networked fundraising works.</h3>
		<p>80% of our donors came via Facebook, after seeing their friends post about it on Facebook. True viral fundraising is the holy grail of the third sector, and quite uncommon.</p>
		<!-- <p>Crowd-funding such a huge amount generated massive interest from major donors, and a ground swell of  media attention, both on and offline.</p> -->
		
		<p>As the Climate Council came from from a digital crowdfunding campaign, it made sense to stay true to those roots and make digital a first class citizen in everything from comms, to culture, to reporting at the board level.</p>
<!-- 		<p><a href="au.linkedin.com/pub/claire-snyder/23/13/163" target="_blank">Claire Snyder</a> (Head of Community) had worked with us previously at at The Foundation for Young Australians, and saw the opportunity to bring Squareweave on as the embedded digital partner for this new adventure.</p> -->

<!-- 		<h3>The thing about digital-first is that traditional third sector challenges become opportunities for growth, transparency and collaboration.</h3> -->

		<h3>People are engaged in climate change issues, but there are few organisations out there providing fact-based, scientific information.</h3>
		<p>It&rsquo;s also been an &lsquo;old-school media&rsquo; game up until now.</p>
		<p>We are also just now learning how much traditional and digital media intersect and back one another up. When TV or radio goes crazy, Facebook does too, and visa versa.</p>
		<hr>
		<h3>There&rsquo;s also big internal-facing opportunities:</h3>
		<dl>
			<dt>1</dt><dd>Digital is <em>cheap</em>. The Climate Council creates this incredible content, and media loves it. But we can put infographics out for 1/30th the price and reach tons more people. The internet does scale, cheap.</dd>
			<dt>2</dt><dd>Being digital-first helps drive organisational culture. We can respond instantly to media, measure our reach and get real data on what  engagement looks like. Less guesswork, more impact. The Climate Council get to try more stuff, things are less formulaic and we&rsquo;re constantly improving.</dd>
			<dt>3</dt><dd>Speed is everything. Capturing the zeitgeist is one thing, but converting that to action requires a constantly evolving online presence.

		<p>Put bluntly, scientists are often dreadful communicators.</p>
		<p>We&rsquo;re bridging the gap to a more general population, on their terms, and making the information meaningful and relevant. It&rsquo;s textbook &lsquo;do internet on it&rsquo; stuff.</p>

		<p>The conversation around measurement usually involves big numbers. Everyone wants to see a million of something. But how can you be sure you&rsquo;re hitting the right audience with the right message, at the right time, to create real impact?</p>
		<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the audience for climate change in Australia.</p>
		<h3>They can be chunked into three broad groups <em>(depending on how you measure them)</em>:</h3>
		<dl>
			<dt>10%</dt><dd><strong>Skeptics.</strong> While it&rsquo;s a wide misconception that skeptics are a majority, it&rsquo;s actually less than 10% of the population. These people are loud, and will be very difficult to convince about climate change.</dd>
			<dt>48%</dt><dd><strong>Unconvinced.</strong> They know it happens, but not quite sure if it matters all that much.</dd>
			<dt>42%</dt><dd><strong>Concerned.</strong> These people get it, support the Climate Council and understand that action is an imperative.</dd>
		</dl>
		<p class="disclaim"><strong>Note:</strong> It&rsquo;s incredibly difficult to be specific about the above figures, as they change depending on how and what you measure. The above is a good representation of the broad brush-strokes.</p>
		<!-- <p class="leadin">pic of 3 impact things here plz...</p> -->
		
		<p><strong>Geek mode:</strong> The core &lsquo;concerned&rsquo; supporter base are both the mechanism for ongoing funding, and the catalyst that triggers reach into the unconvinced body in the middle, where the <em>real impact</em> happens.</p>
		<p>For example, we know that shares of online content by supporters that lead to new views by the ‘unconvinced&rsquo; category are massively more valuable than shares within our own echo chamber.</p>

		<p>We&rsquo;re now excited to gather meta data about how the conversation is changing in the wild, as we&rsquo;re attempting to influence the public media narrative.</p>	

		<p>Importantly, we want to be able to trace this cause and effect back to The Climate Council&rsquo;s intervention. We can already map positive and negative coverage around certain issues, but we&rsquo;re going to do this with even more granularity.</p>

			The 'it actually works' bit:
			We're growing really quickly. In particular, we've become really effective. We do 15 page reports with great media messages. Infographics. Interem reports. More impact bang for buck.
			With less resources than we had within the commission (in gobmint) we're doing more, with less money.
			We're hitting  tons more people offline, and then even more people online! More of both.
			Less money, more impact. It actually works.
			We were smart enough to not do the implementation bit ourselves. 
			We're all about elevating experts. We work with the best scientist and we value expertise. We surround ourselves with the best brains so we don't fuck about.
			That's why we chose to work with the experts in technical implementation.
