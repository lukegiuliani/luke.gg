		<h3>Many geeky organisations claim some sort of non-traditional company structure.</h3>
		<p>We&rsquo;ve flirted with <a href="http://www.valvesoftware.com/company/Valve_Handbook_LowRes.pdf" target="_blank">flat <small>(PDF)</small></a>, <a href="http://joelonsoftware.com/articles/ladder.html" target="_blank">laddered</a> and other paradigms for telling the story of our structure and growth patterns.</p>
		<p>In this page I&rsquo;ll attempt to explain how we work, which we can tentatively label our &lsquo;organic structure&rsquo;.</p>

		<h3><a href="https://twitter.com/willdayble">Will</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/lukegiuliani">Luke</a> started it all</h3>
		<p>The first lines of code were committed by these fools on the 12th of August, 2008. Nowadays they are involved in strategic and board-level decisions, whilst floating around the edges doing other stuff.</p>

		<h3>The company structure is similar to any professional services firm.</h3>
		<p>That is to say we employ a collection of clever people.</p>
		<p>Other companies hire us as a group to solve problems for them. These are mostly digital in nature, but extend through to strategy, organisational culture and training.</p>
		<p>The overall unit format looks like this:</p>
		<p class="img"><img src="<?php ET::image('organic/delivery-sales-ops.png'); ?>" alt="3 bits"></p>
		<dl>
			<dt>15%</dt><dd><strong>Operations</strong> makes everything run. Accounts, management, HR, culture maintenance and so on.</dd>
			<dt>15%</dt><dd><strong>Sales</strong> finds us the right kinds of clients and makes us look nice to the world.</dd>
			<dt>70%</dt><dd><strong>Delivery</strong> do all the billable stuff. Code and project management and BA / PM type stuff.</dd>
		</dl>	
		<p>The above is an operational roles guideline. For example, at a size of 3 people, everyone would do a bit of everything. At 25 we have individual people doing accounts, sales, project management, etc.</p>
		<p>At the 25 people break-point another similar organism would be birthed, working to the same rules, and scaled.</p>
		<p>Reporting within these three areas should be two-directional and discreet. Think of it like APIs between good self contained systems. The right amount of comms, at the right time, for the right reason.</p>
		<p class="behaviour"><small>Behaviour example</small>The delivery / ops teams need to give constant feedback to sales. Having someone from those teams in weekly sales sprint meetings keeps an open dialogue.</p>
		<hr>
		<h3>Typical roles</h3>
		<p>Importantly, these are <em>roles</em>, not people. Certain talented folks may do multiple roles, or move between them.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Operations:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>General Manager:</strong> Responsible for the health, happiness and productivity of the delivery and sales teams. The only person directly responsible to the board.</li>
					<li><strong>Office Assistant:</strong> Keeps the troops fed and watered. Helps people keep the space clean, keeps us stocked in beer and healthy food.</li>
					<li><strong>Accounts:</strong> Makes sure clients pay their bills and employees get paid.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Sales:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Matchmaker:</strong> Friendly, front-food people who understand the kinds of people / organisations we work with best. Good at making friends with these kinds of people.</li>
					<li><strong>BDM:</strong> More traditionally &lsquo;business&rsquo; oriented sales folks. Lots of tenders, RFQs and classic B2B sales work.</li>
					<li><strong>Brand manager:</strong> Somewhere between marketing, advertising and lean customer development. Making collateral, outreach material and stuff that shows off how awesome we are.</li>
					<li><strong>Strategist:</strong> Defines market approach, targets, cost of acquisition and other overarching goals within which the sales team operates.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Delivery:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Application Developer:</strong> Back-end centric problem solving programming role.</li>
					<li><strong>Front-end dev:</strong> Heavily technical top-of-the-stack centric dev, with a focus on UX architecture, page load times, accessibility and device compatibility.</li>
					<li><strong>Designer:</strong> Visual and UX design, branding, all the way through to language, customer development and user flow stuff.</li>								<li><strong>Agile Iteration Manager:</strong> Essentially a classic PM role, but with strengths in Agile sprints. Reporting to and management of clients and staff, resourcing, etc.</li>
					<li><strong>Business Intelligence:</strong> Process-oriented analysis folks who work almost exclusively with clients on the nuts and bolts of their business function, with a view to translate that into a digital framework.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The above are examples to illustrate our breadth, not categorical roles that must exist for us to function.</p>

	</div>

	<div class="constrain">
		<h3>How is often more important than what.</h3>
		<p>From the <a href="<?php EF::dest('') ?>truth">base truth</a> that we will be solving new problems with new technology every year, <em>how</em> we do stuff is often more important than what tools we use on any given day.</p>
		<hr>
		<h3>Finding truth in what we do.</h3>
		<p>We build upon Simon Sinek&rsquo;s golden circle idea, i.e. that you have to know <em>who you are</em> and <em>how you do stuff</em> before you actually build anything. (See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5Tw0PGcyN0" target="_blank">the video</a>.)</p>
		<p class="img">
			<img src="<?php ET::image('organic/golden-circle.png'); ?>" alt="image">
		</p>
		<p class="behaviour"><small>Behaviour example</small>If ever someone&rsquo;s stuck on a problem without an obvious answer,  ask <a href="<?php EF::dest('') ?>truth#principles">&ldquo;Is why I&rsquo;m doing helping people, growth and constantly bettering?&rdquo;</a> as per first principles.</p>
		<hr>
		<h3>Congruence</h3>
		<p>If we extend this idea to include our clients, we find that everyone does better work if we&rsquo;re all on the same page.</p>
		<p class="img">
			<img src="<?php ET::image('organic/congruence.png'); ?>" alt="image">
		</p>		

		<p class="behaviour"><small>Behaviour example</small>Client matchmakers / sales staff should ask <strong>why</strong> a client wants to do digital, before asking about functional specifications of any app.</p>
		<h3>Example: The &lsquo;First Date&rsquo; project</h3>
		<p>The first project with any new client should be as small, self contained and clearly measurable as possible.</p>
		<p>Building stuff together with the <em>explicit aim to learn</em> is the fastest way to get our heads around the relationship, figure out the best way to work together.</p>
		<hr>
		<h3>Trust trumps all</h3>
		<p>In looking over our best and worst client relationships, we&rsquo;ve learn that trust is vital. Most screw-ups in digital happen when there&rsquo;s a breakdown of trust between the vendor and client.</p>
		<p class="behaviour"><small>Behaviour example</small>Calling clients every few weeks to gauge <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter" target="_blank">Net promoter scores</a>, whilst not an exact metric, opens up the conversation to constantly better the relationship.</p>
		
		<p>Accordingly, processes should be created around building and maintaining trust, within and without the company.</p>
		<p class="behaviour"><small>Behaviour example</small>Having clients eat lunch at our round-table daily lunches breaks everyone out of their work-brain thinking and help us connect as human beings.</p>

		<h3>&lsquo;How&rsquo; is often a question about <em>when</em>.</h3>
		<p>The daily / weekly / monthly organisational rhythms sets the heartbeat for motivation, clarity and progress.</p>
		<p>The aim is to keep things as snappy and crisp, even if the actual actual things done change as we evolve.</p>
		<hr>
		<h3>Some example rhythms (as of Aug 2014):</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Every day at 12:50pm, teams should down tools and do a 5 minute round-table, focussing on what&rsquo;s blocking people from working well that afternoon.</li>
			<li>Lunch happens at 1pm every day, together, with free food and no shop talk allowed.</li>
			<li>Friday at 4pm we all down tools, have a beer and spend an hour and a half talking about what was good, bad and needs change in the week. Focus on showcasing achievements, and resolving tensions.</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="behaviour"><small>Behaviour example</small>Just before 4pm on Friday, someone goes and buys a bunch of beer, then runs around telling everyone to stop working so we can have friday catchup.</p>
		<hr>
		<p><strong>Importantly,</strong> the above is a starting position, not an end point. Keep questioning, stay kind, and stay foolish.</p>
		<p>Much love,<br><em>- Will</em></p>
